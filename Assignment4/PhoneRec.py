2.	Write a Python program that reads phone numbers from a dictionary called phonebook 
and writes them to a file named "SpeedDial1.txt", with each phone number appearing 
in a single-column format (one number per line).

The dictionary follows this structure:
phonebook = {  
    'John': ('209 Trafalgar Road', '905-666-7777'),  
    'Rosie': ('1439 Trafalgar Road', '487-423-7721')  
}
(You may add more entries to the dictionary.)
Create a Git repository for this project.
Name the Python file "PhoneRec.py" and mark it as Version 1 in your Git history.
