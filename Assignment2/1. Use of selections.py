# Write a program that would use nested if /if-else. 
# In this program a variable called temper stores a randomly generated number between 1 and 400. 
# If the generated value is above 100, the program prints “ temperature above boiling point” 
# and uses a second if to check whether the temper is above 320 degrees;
# in that case the program prints “temperature above smoke point”. 
# For temper lower than 100 the program prints “ temperature is not very high”. 
# Flowchart is required in this program. 
# Student should also suggest what are some of the weaknesses in this problem
