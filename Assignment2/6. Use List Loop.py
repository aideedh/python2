# b) Write a program that uses a list called scores initialized with 10 values.
# The program iterates over the list and determines studentâ€™s grade for the given score, 
# as done in week3 lesson. Student must use elif construct to determine the grades based 
# on the following criteria: score>80 is grade A, score between 70 and 80 is grade B, 
# score between 60 and 70 is grade C, score between 50 and 60 is grade D and score less than 50 is grade D. 
# Use any loop of you choice. Student must provide a flowchart for this program
