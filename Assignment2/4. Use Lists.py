# Write a program to calculate standard deviation of a list of integers. 
# This program should use a function called Avg() that calculates and returns average of the list passed 
# as a parameter. 
# The main program passes that average to another function called sumSqDiff()
# that also accepts a list as an argument and returns the sum square of the difference of list values 
# and the average. sumSqDiff() implements this formula ssd



def Avg(list):

    # Thinking:
    # list passed as a paramenter
    # so the sum of the list must be done than divided by count of list

    for number in list:
        # for loop to calc the sum of the list
