'''
Write a  program in python to simulate a game called MyGame.py. 
In this game you will use three variables called player1, player2 and player3. 
Each player rolls a dice, which means that the variables are initialized with random 
integers ranging from 1 to 6. Compare the values of player1, player2 and player3 to find
the highest value. Print that highest value. Use comments and import statements wherever applicable. 
Give screenshots of the code, output and git repository containing this program.

import random

# assign a random value to all three players
player1 = random.randint(1, 6)
player2 = random.randint(1, 6)
player3 = random.randint(1, 6)
