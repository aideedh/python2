Implement the following as version 3 and add the code to computer average score of all three players in 
problem 2.  
The average will be calculated and printed twice. Once using ‘/’ operator and then using ‘//’ operator.  
For example: 
 average1= (player1+ player2+player3)/3  # average using  ‘/’ operator
 average2= (player1+player2+player3)//3 # average using ‘//’ operator
Explain your observations. Remove the parenthesis from the equations and print average1 and average2 
again.  
Give screenshots of the code, outputs and the git repository
